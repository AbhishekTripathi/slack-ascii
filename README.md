## Usage

Just type `/ascii [keyword]`, and a clone of yourself will pop-in and respond with an emoticon. Use `help` as the keyword to get a list of available emoticons.

## Installation

The overall installation process involves the following:
 - Creating a Slash Command integration to trigger slack-ascii
 - Creating an Incoming Webhook integration to receive a response from the server
 - Acquiring the Slack Web API token for your team to allow the response to mimic the user that triggered the command
 - Configuring and deploying the Heroku app to host this bot
